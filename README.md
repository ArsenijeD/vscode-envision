# Envision for Visual Studio Code

An extension that provides basic support for Envision, a DSL developed by Lokad.

* `.nvn` files get recognized and colored as Envision scripts.
* Press `F6` to compile the Envision script.

The compilation command sends the script to `try.lokad.com`. This extension does not contain an Envision compiler. It leveraes the public compilation endpoint supported by Lokad.
